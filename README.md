Graduate Student at University of Michigan Mechanical Engineering

I work on topics in uncertainty quantification with a particular interest in building surrogate models from the perspective of experimental design and active learning. I am also generally interested in building these models for the small / multi-event data setting, which is frequently encountered in scientific domains with sparse observations because of constraints imposed by the operating environment and the phenomenon under study. Currently exploring:

- Active learning
- Neural ODEs and related methods
- Bayesian OED for Surrogate Model Training
- Application of UQ Methods to Space Weather data.
- (collaboration) Adaptive Covariance Estimation Techniques
