Graduate Student at University of Michigan!

I work on topics in uncertainty quantification with a particular interest in surrogate models and their role in methods for experimental design. Currently exploring:

- Active learning
- Neural ODEs and related methods
- Bayesian Inference for Surrogate Model Training
- Application of UQ Methods to Space Weather data.
