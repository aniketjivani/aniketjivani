Graduate Student at University of Michigan Mechanical Engineering

I work on topics in uncertainty quantification with a particular interest in building surrogate models from the perspective of experimental design. I am also generally interested in building models in the small data setting, which is frequently encountered in scientific domains with sparse observations because of constraints imposed by the operating environment and the phenomenon under study. Currently exploring:

- Active learning
- Neural ODEs and related methods
- Bayesian OED for Surrogate Model Training
- Application of UQ Methods to Space Weather data.
