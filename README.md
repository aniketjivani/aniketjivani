Graduate Student at University of Michigan Mechanical Engineering

I work on topics in uncertainty quantification with a particular interest in the use of surrogate models for different aspects of UQ, including experimental design. Currently exploring:

- Active learning
- Neural ODEs and related methods
- Bayesian Inference for Surrogate Model Training
- Application of UQ Methods to Space Weather data.
